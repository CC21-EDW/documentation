# Naming Conventions

## Maven
Within Maven we have the following naming conventions:
* `groupId`: we use `com.baloise.open.edw` ("edw" = "Event Driven Workflow")
* `artifactId`: we provide a descriptive name with dashes as separator

The rationales for this are:
* we want a very simple and easy standard.
* this standard should apply to de-facto guidelines

With this we achieve the following:
* All logically connected components are easily identified
